# Character Sheet for D&D 5e 2024

A fillable character sheet for D&D 5e 2024.

This character sheet is structured differently from the one provided by Wizard of the Coast, in that it is structured so that elements are organized by their purpose and usage, rather than by type. For instance, there are no "Class Features" or "Species Traits", but "Traits", "Actions", "Special Actions", "After a Long Rest", etc.
